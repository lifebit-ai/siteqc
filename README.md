**Genomics England's workflow for variant quality control and annotation**.

## Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

2. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```bash
    nextflow run lifebit-ai/siteqc -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
    ```

4. Start running your own analysis!

    <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

    ```bash
    nextflow run nf-core/siteqc --input s3://lifebit-featured-datasets/projects/gel/siteqc/input.csv
    ```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Documentation

The lifebit-ai/siteqc pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline which you can find in the [`docs/` directory](docs).

## Credits

The `siteqc` was originally written by Daniel Rhodes and the Genomics England Bioinformatics team.

The Nextflow implementation of the pipeline was developed by Christina Chatzipantsiou, Vlad Dembrovskyi for use by Genomics England and collaborators.
